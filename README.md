Welcome!
This is a TDD project for LeetCode solutions in C.

# What is TDD?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on
software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully
developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the
software against all test cases.

# How to run each program?

Programs and test cases are organized with Makefile. Do `make` before running:
```bash
$ make
$ ./test
$ make clean
```

# How to contribute to this project?

Firstly, all people are welcomed to contribute to this project.

Secondly, there are some rules to remember before making PR:
1. Use kernel coding style.
2. Be cautious to end file with LF instead CRLF to work well in Linux.
3. Remember to write test cases when solving a new problem.
